## How It Works

1. The website takes the city name input from the user.
2. The website sends a request to the OpenWeatherMap API to fetch weather data for the given city.
3. The fetched data is parsed and displayed to the user, showing details like temperature and weather description.
4. The website also handles errors if the city is not found or if the API request fails.
